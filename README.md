# word-guess-game

## Deployment

This hangman game is deployed on github pages at https://jwmann13.github.io/word-guess-game

## Usage

A very simple hangman style game with a changing image indicator. Each answer will be the name of a fruit.

Press the key corresponding to the letter you want to guess. The javascript will recognize the letter and let you know if you guess was correct or incorrect. Correct guesses will be highlighted with white and boldened in the list of letters to the left and added to the correct position in the blanks above. Incorrect guesses will be highlighted with red and struck-through.

When each fruit in the image has a bite taken from it or the word is completed the game is over and you will be alerted whether you have lost or won, and the game will reset.
